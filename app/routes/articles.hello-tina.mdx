  I originally built this portfolio site back in 2018, and since then it's
  evolved quite a bit. Recently I migrated from Create React App to Next.js and
  made some major upgrades in the process.

### file structure

* package.json
  dependencies, project parameters
* package-lock.json

### Components:

* variables can be raw html - no need for quotes. eg:

```jsx
 const email = <h2> ded@ded.ded</h2>;
```

* component: function that returns JSX/html content - like component variables can be raw html. Component name must be capitalised
* function: returns variable or none. Function name can be any case
* Components are for templating. Return statement can be inline JSX. eg:

```jsx
 const User = () => {
 return (
   <div>
       <h1>Jack</h1>
       <h1>22</h1>
       <h1>jack@ded.com</h1>
 );
 }
```

* Injecting component into html, other components as a tag. eg:

```jsx
 function App() {
 return (
   <div className="App">
       <User />
   </div>
 );
 }
```

### Props:

* Parameters passed to components as key/value pairs. Passed to component as props. eg:

```jsx
 const User = (props) => {}
```

* props prefix for each variable surrounded by curly braces. eg:

```jsx
 const User = (props) => {
 return (
   <div>
       <h1>{props.name}</h1>
       <h1>{props.age}</h1>
       <h1>{props.email}</h1>
 );
 }
```

* Props values are passed as tag variable elements. Strings in double quotes, numbers in curly braces. eg:

```jsx
 function App() {
 return (
   <div className="App">
       <User name="Jack" age={21} email="jack@ded.com" />
   </div>
 );
 }
```
