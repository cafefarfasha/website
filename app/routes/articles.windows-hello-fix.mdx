Recently, I upgraded to a new laptop. Upon trying to set up Windows Hello facial recognition, I was met with the error message: 

> Something went wrong. Try again Later

Scouring google yielded many workarounds and guides, yet nothing worked. I decided to troubleshoot it myself.

I first checked event viewer. Browsed through "Application and Service Logs / Microsoft / Windows / Biometrics"

Found the following notice:

That gave me a clue to what is happening.

### The Solution

* Open Group Policy Editor by typing "gpedit" in the start menu and selecting the first result.
* Navigate to:
  * Computer Configuration / Administrative Templates / Windows Components / Biometrics / Allow the use of biometrics
* Set it to enabled

The issue is resolved.
