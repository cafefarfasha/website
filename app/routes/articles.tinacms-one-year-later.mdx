Things I have discovered:

| **Issue**                                                                                    | **Resolution**                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TinaCMS admin panel render error when building/publishing with npm                           | You will need to dedupe react-router-dom in the dependencies: Best method is to use npx patcher |
| Admin panel fails to render after deleting a page/post/entry when running TinaCMS on Windows | Stop the local dev server, run \`tinacms audit\` in the console, restart dev server             |
